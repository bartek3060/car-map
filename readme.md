## Reflection

This project was built during the recruitment process for the position of junior react developer. Finally I work as
Angular developer but after some time I decided to refresh my React skills and make this app better mainly by adding
Typescript and refactoring existing code what will be done in the future.

When I was building the initial version of this project, the main goal was to create application which will get data
from external service by http requests and share them across whole application using React Context.

This project helped me to improve programming skills and also learn the core concepts of React: Components and
communication between them, React hooks, React Context and also get knowledge how to use Typescript in different
framework than Angular.
